## Introduction

The fear women and queers have endured for generations lives in our hearts and bodies. It moves us and moves with us wherever we go. How do we fill our hearts again after experiences of pain and misogyny? In healing we find our own voices—intuitive, poetic, non-linear. Writing these songs became a way to record transformation, to give ourselves what we need. Women’s stories, erased from paper, live embodiedly. In performance we weave songs with the audience’s voices. Let us sing them out as a collective ritual, repeat them until they become a sanctuary for all: healing, safe and powerful.

**Feral-ferous** presents it's first performance at *YPAM* in Yokohama, Japan on the 12the and 13th of December 2025.
